the mathematical field of Graph Theory is foundational to Computer Science (e.g. shortest path algorithms), with numerous applications to chemistry, social networks, chip design, molecular biology, optimal scheduling, etc.
A well-known application of Graph Theory is Facebook, since Facebook is an example of a “social network”. Each person is a vertex (point), and each friendship/connection is an edge (line). Facebook recommends you to be friends with someone if you and that person have lots of mutual friendships.

Key Takeaway: We can solve many complex Computer Science problems by representing the information visually, and using a table or a graph to uncover patterns and structure.
